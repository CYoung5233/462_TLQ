# FaaSET - Function-as-a-Service Experiment Toolkit

The FaaSET notebook provides an integrated development environment as a Jupyter notebook to streamline the process of developing Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
applications, invoking and testing functions, executing experiments, training performance models, and processing results.
The Function-as-a-Service Experiment Toolkit (FaaSET) notebook
supports many FaaS platforms including AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, IBM Cloud Functions,
Azure Functions, and OpenFaaS. Platform agnostic functions are written inside a Jupyter notebook as standard Python
functions and then are automatically packaged, deployed, and can be invoked from inside the FaaSET notebook. FaaSET builds upon
a strong foundation of tools designed specifically for FaaS development, deployment, and experimentation, such as the Serverless
Application Analytics Framework (SAAF), FaaS Runner, ReportGenerator and more.
